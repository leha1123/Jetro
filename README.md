# Jetro
My first project on GitHub

Hi everyone, My name is Ha. Let me introduce a bit of myself to you, ok? Yep, I'm 22 years old. Now, I'm a fourth years student at Vietnam National University of Agriculture. And my major is Information Technology (It so called "IT").

It's glad to work on GitHub. And this is the first time i work on it. I have just created a project named "Jetro". Jetro is a template about HTML, CSS that i have to do. This is a request of my friend who helps me to learn PHP.
